# CB Platinum Inspection System

CB Platinum was a Airbnb Management Company, managing dozens of properties in and around London for investors. CB Platinum handled everything from property set-up to guest stays, cleaning and more.

This system was initially designed to provide property managers with the capacity to create inspection reports on the condition of the property. 

Plans to expand the system to manage cleaners, linen order and delivery, stock management and more were made, however before work to expand the system could even start, Covid-19 brought about the demise of the company, as without global travel, the need for short stay apartments vanished.

The system was built on a backend of Node and Mongo DB.
